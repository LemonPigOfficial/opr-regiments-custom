              Welcome! This is a super simple lightweight app that will take your Army Forge list,
              multiply all of the unit sizes by 1-2x, do the same for unit toughness of single
			  model units, and optionally add blast template rules.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              Start by entering the "Share by link" URL from Army Forge in the box below, and hit
              "Start" to view the modified list.
            </Typography>

          <ShareListLoader />
        </Container>
